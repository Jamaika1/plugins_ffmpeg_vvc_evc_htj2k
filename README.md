This project is just amateur ffmpeg compilation scheme with additions in gcc 11.3.1 and nasm 2.17rc0 from .bat file.
In this scheme I tried to eliminate repeated add-on functions. I corrected some errors. I don't know how it could be compiled in the recommended MSVC.
I managed to compile free librsvg. This project is avoided under Windows due to problem of reading fonts from svg files. Perhaps it`s an unnecessary addition to HTML pages today.
